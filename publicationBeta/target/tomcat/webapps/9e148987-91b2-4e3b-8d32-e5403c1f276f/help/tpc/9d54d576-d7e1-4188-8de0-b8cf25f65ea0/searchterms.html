      <li>With Do It! mode, you are guided through a task while you perform it in the live application. This unique mode makes it possible for you to accomplish real work while you learn.</li>
      <li>When a topic is played in Do It! mode, the Do It! window opens on top of the target application. The top section of the window includes step-by-step instructions for completing the task. When you complete a step, you click the Next Step button to display instructions for the next step or to skip a step. The Previous Step button appears after you perform the first step in the topic, allowing you to move back to a previous step. If a key combination was set in the Preferences window, you can use that combination to advance to the next step in Do It! mode. A key combination is not available to navigate back to the previous step, however.</li>
      <li>Do It! mode does not stay on top in Internet Explorer 11 or later versions. The key combination to advance in Do It! mode does not work in Firefox or Internet 11 or later.</li>
      <li>Note:</li>
      <li>The bottom section of the Do It! window displays a graphic that illustrates how the screen should appear in the live application for the step. On the graphic, a marquee surrounds the area in which you should perform the action in the live application. You can drag the graphic to reposition it within the Do It! window, if necessary. You can also drag the lower right corner of the Do It! window to resize it and display more of the graphic or you can use the Show/Hide Graphic button to toggle the display of the graphic in the Do It! window. You can also move the Do It! window to another area of the screen by dragging the title bar to the desired location on the screen.</li>
